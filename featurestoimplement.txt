Project: Implement a mass-spring physical simulation, 
and use it to animate squishy objects or cloth. Look up peridynamics, 
and use it to implement fracture (breaking of objects) when they collide 
with each other or the floor.

REQUIRED
 - Cloth ***
 - Squishy Objects (Ball/Other imported)
 - Peridynamics

Should Implement

Improvements
 - Remove uneeded files?
 - Move cam back for all, so can see the cloth directly
 - Starting scene should not have cloth conflicting
 - Minecraft skybox (and maybe lighting) so not as dark

Toggling
 - Toggle b/w different scenes and tests (ensure that they all work)
 - button to enable/disable corner point/center point
 - Can type number of faces (for the face tests)
 - Reset should replay the current animation enabled w/ updated params if they changed

Squishy Object
 - Implement squishy ball being dropped
 - WASD to move potentially

Peridynamics
 - Implement

Different Tests
 - Test to demo each 1-# face (3 seconds for each face test) just run through them



Additional +features
 - Figure out how to import different models
 - Game Dev where blow up ball using Space and wasd to move (make one level or something)
